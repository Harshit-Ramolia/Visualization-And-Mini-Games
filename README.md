# Algorithm Visualizations and Mini Games

This is a compilation website to visualize algorithms such as backtracking, sorting, searching, etc.

## Sudoku Solver

Used backtracking algorithm to solve a sudoku and displayed each steps, since this is for visualization purpose, I have added a progress bar, which can be tracked because we already know the total number of steps. Regenerating Sudoku puzzle using this api https://sugoku.herokuapp.com/board?difficulty=easy.

A simple comparison between binary search and linear search on randomly generated sorted list and a randomly generated search number between 1 to 100.

## Merge Sort

A simple visualization representation of merge sort of randomly generated list.

## Tower Of Hanoi
