## Sudoku Solver

Used backtracking algorithm to solve a sudoku and displayed each steps, since this is for visualization purpose, I have added a progress bar, which can be tracked because we already know the total number of steps. Regenerating Sudoku puzzle using this api https://sugoku.herokuapp.com/board?difficulty=easy.

## Binary Search Vs Linear Search

A simple comparison between binary search and linear search on randomly generated sorted list and a randomly generated search number between 1 to 100.

## Merge Sort

A simple visualization representation of merge sort of randomly generated list.

## Tower Of Hanoi

Step visualization of a famous puzzle called Tower Of Hanoi which can be solved with the help of recursion.

## 2048

Famous game 2048, can be played by arrow keys. Goal is to reach number 2048. This project does not contain any animation yet, but the game can be played, it keeps track of score and checks whether a player won or lost.
